Hi, I want to work as a react developer or a aws cloud dev ops engineer. 

I have a tremoundous amount of experience in what I refer to as, lagacy platforms.

I work hard and always show up. I practice forebearance and patience when interacting with peers, I follow directions given to me, and I am eager to learn.
